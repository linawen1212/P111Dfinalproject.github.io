        Many school bullying actors are still at large and their responsibilities cannot be pursued. Therefore, in order to properly deal with bullying, relevant laws and regulations should be formulated to establish a sound legal mechanism for campus bullying and punishment. School bullying has become an important issue that has plagued the education development of countries all over the world. The degree is serious and the nature is so bad that it is shocking. School bullying refers to a specific group (individual) that acts on the bullied person for a sustained, long-term effect through language, behavior, and other media means, causing psychological and physical harm. During the bullying process, the bully does not recognize his own wrong behavior, and the bully does not dare or can't resist.

      <h2> The Risk of Not Preventing the Childhood Bullying Right Away</h2>

      <p>The article <i>“Bullying in elementary school: an American perspective”</i> by Kathleen said that childhood bullying on campus is often large and composed of tight or loose gangs. Most of the time they lacked compassion for the students who were victimized, and they were recognized by some of their classmates. Their behavior was more violent than other students.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-4">
      <p>In the case of study for childhood bullying by author Kathleen mention that bullies often fail to recognize that their behavior is wrong or even illegal. They do not understand the suffering of the bully. They think that this is just a game. There is a phenomenon in school bullying that must be recognized.

        Campus bullying is a small problem on the surface, but it can have serious consequences. Because of the lack of outside attention and help, the bullied person becomes the inner despair from the initial external injury, and more likely to commit suicide.

            The researchers at Iowa State University in the United States found that some minors are irrational and even contradictory in the value orientation of life. Due to the indulgence of parents, many of the disadvantaged children have been diluted and ignored, and some bad behaviors have not been stopped in time.
          </p>
          <p>
            These small shortcomings and misplaced behaviors slowly develop the child's narrow, selfish and ruthless personality, so that the child cannot restrain his behavior through rationality and norms when dealing with problems, but is self-centered.

              Once their own interests have been violated by the outside world, these children will immediately take some extreme actions to counterattack, sometimes even by hurting each other to maintain their status and interests. What's more, these self-centered children slowly form the illusion that others must obey me. They brought this illusion into the campus. In the process of interacting with their classmates, they forced everyone to obey themselves through strong language and hegemonic behavior. Other weak people are voluntarily or forced to rely on them in order not to be bullied.

      The author Kere Hughes Beldhing said “in the education and teaching and team meetings, the school should strengthen the education of bullying prevention. Close contact with students every day, pay attention to the daily life of students, especially pay attention to the bosses and vulnerable individuals of the sub-groups to find bullying problems early.” It emphasizes that through education, teachers should improve their ability to prevent bullying, pay attention to the basic conditions of children who are vulnerable to bullying, and conduct targeted psychological intervention and behavior correction for these groups.

      The guardian and the school must work closely together to repair the psychological damage of the bully.

        The author of Richard T. Scarpaci said that “after the school bullying incident, we must first pay attention to the safety of the bully and confirm the nature of the bullying incident”. It means teachers must correctly understand the bullying incident, help the victim to get out of the psychological shadow, guide the victim to improve their ability to protect themselves, and prevent similar incidents. Guardians and teachers must work together to collect information and discuss solutions, and to obtain cooperation between the school and other relevant functional departments.

    <h2> The Final Solution: Childhood Bullying Prevention</h2>

  <div class="col-12">

          Each age group has different emotional needs as the child grows, says the author Gaspar, in general data, peer relationships are one of the most important relationships for children. When they are 9-12 years old, they are particularly concerned about friendship and fear of loneliness. When they enter the juvenile period, they are afraid of “companion pressure” and care about what others think of themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The article <i>“A serious game-based solution to prevent bullying”</i> by Raminhos, Claudio, Carmo, Gaspar, Carvalhosa, and Candeias said that there must be a firm attitude toward the bully’s criticism, and it should be dealt with in a timely manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The author Raminhos comment that school administrators should constantly improve the awareness of faculty and staff on the crisis of bullying. In the event of a bullying incident, teachers should help teachers solve problems. Teachers, guardians, and other relevant personnel should exchange information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The author Carmo said three suggestions that might help out the children who get bullied. The first suggestion not to ask the teacher or the school to punish the bully because it is beyond the authority of the parent. The second suggestion is, don't try to get things big in exchange for the school's understanding, and don't complain to the "Board of Education" when the school is still negotiating. This will only allow the following coordinators to work without any effort. The third suggestion does not let the school or the teacher fear you, and not to punish the bully, to stop the next bullying is the key and also don’t try to reconcile with bullies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the author Claudio mention that children who are easily bullied on campus are often children with moderate grades, few words, no confidence, and silence. Good students, children with good family and special skills are relatively easy to be bullied. Therefore, parents can give their children more extracurricular things, and have some specialties, any learning achievements can make children more confident.
